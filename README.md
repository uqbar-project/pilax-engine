# Pilax-Engine #

Pilax is a port of the [Pilas Engine](http://pilas-engine.com.ar/) to the [Xtend programming language](http://www.eclipse.org/xtend/) therefore to the JVM.

Pilas Engine is a 2d game engine written in Python.
So Pilax is a game engine for the Java VM.

### Screenshots ###

Here are some sample app's screenshots and screencasts.
All of the examples were actually migrated from original Pilas engine's samples.
Also note that these all are screencast trasformed into animated gif's so there's a quality loss on images.
